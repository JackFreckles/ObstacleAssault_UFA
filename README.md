# Project 1 - ObstacleAssault_UFA

Developed with Unreal Engine 5

This repository contains the first of four small gameplay projects completed as part of a Udemy course that's focused on learning how to use Unreal Engine and gameplay programming fundamentals

## What I implemented
- Created an actor class using C++ that moves back and forth between positions over time
- Added optional rotation with configurable direction and speed
- Exposed movement distance, movement speed, and rotation values to the Unreal Editor
- Used time based logic to ensure consistent behavior across different frame rates
- Created Blueprint child classes to inherit from C++ file for easy in editor manipulation of meshes and values

## Level Design
- Built a simple vertical traversal level using modular assets
- Imported and integrated free FAB assets under the standard license

## What I learned
- Some of the Unreal Engine specific macros and functions in C++
- Navigating the Unreal Editor and level building tools
- Exposing variables for designer friendly tuning
- Transforming and moving Actors within Unreal Engine
